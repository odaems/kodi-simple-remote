## How to use this app

This app can talk to V8 of the Kodi JSON API to manage a playlist and start/stop playback.

### Start this app after cloning:
First you need to install node.js and npm and use npm to globally install ionic and cordova:

```bash
$ sudo npm install -g ionic cordova
```

Afterwards you can start the app from the project root (e.g. for android): 

```bash
$ ionic cordova platform add android
$ ionic cordova run android
```

Substitute android for ios for iPhone and iPad when you're on a mac.
